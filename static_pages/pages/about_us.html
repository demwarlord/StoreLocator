                Peter Jackson's passion for tailoring and high quality fabrics began in 1948 in the retail heart of Melbourne's CBD on Little Bourke Street. When siblings Olga, Peter and David Jackson opened their first barbershop, they had no inclination that their humble hairstyling ambitions would develop into an iconic Australian fashion institution.<br /><br /> The barbershop also sold ties and despite their success in styling hair, it soon became apparent to the trio that their penchant for panache could be better applied to fashion. Their modest line of ties gradually evolved into a full tailored men's range and Peter Jackson promptly established itself as the number one destination for distinguishing men's fashion in Melbourne.<br /><br /> Over 60 years and 3 generations later, Peter Jackson's approach has never been more focused. As our brand continues to grow nationally, so does our dedication to providing, luxury, innovation and excellence tailored to meet every man's needs.<br /><br /> Never compromising quality for cost, our garments continue to be constructed from world-class European textiles that transcend traditional menswear by placing a focused emphasis on offering elegant attire that's attainable for every man.</div>
