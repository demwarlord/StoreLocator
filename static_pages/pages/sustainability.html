                    We believe in creating a sustainable future for the world of fashion, aligning ourselves with suppliers that are dedicated to reducing their carbon footprint. Suppliers, like Marzotto in Italy, whose investment in solar energy has saved the use of close to a one million litres of oil since November 2011. <br /><br /> The Reda mill also stands out as a key sustainable supplier, whose dedication to environmental controls and introduction of a water purification plant in 2004, has earned them an EMAS certification. In working with companies like these, we are able to move towards our goals in minimising our impact and creating an environmentally secure future.<br /><br /> We believe by following this mantra and supporting ethical and sustainable trade, we can promote a healthy industry standard that benefits every person involved.</div>
